Mmm... come on

I don't wanna go another day
So I'm telling you exactly what is on my mind
Seems like everybody's breaking up
They're throwing their love away
But I know I got a good thing right here
That's why I say... hey

Nobody gonna love me better
I'mma stickwitu forever
Nobody gonna take me higher
I'mma stickwitu
You know how to appreciate me
I'mma stickwitu, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I'mma stickwitu

Through everything goin' on
We're right here holdin' on to one another
The reason why I love ya
Your charm and personality
I love your sensitivity
Wait... let me take a second
'Cause I'll be your love and essence
Only wanna hear your voice speak
And I feel your body heat
Love every minute of it
You're like the fresh air
When it feels like no one cares
That's why I'm saying, baby...

Nobody gonna love me better (Nobody's gon' love me better)
I'mma stickwitu forever (Ohh No)
Nobody gonna take me higher (Nobody)
I'mma stickwitu (No)
You know how to appreciate me (I know you love me)
I'mma stickwitu, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way (Ohh)
I'mma stickwitu (Nobody)

And now
Ain't nothin else I could need (nothin' else I could need)
And I'm
I'm singin 'cause you're still so into me
I got you
We'll be making love endlessly
I'm with you (Baby I'm with you)
Baby you're with me (Baby you're with me)

So don't you worry about
People hanging around
They ain't bringing us down
Baby, talk to me
'Cause all I'm here to say
Is that I'll be right here for forever ever and a day, hey

Nobody gonna love me better
I'mma stickwitu forever
Nobody gonna take me higher

You're a shelter in a storm
I'm right here
You're keeping me away from harm
I'm never gonna leave you
You're a song with beautiful words
I'm your song
Something that I never heard

You know how to appreciate me
I'mma stickwitu my baby (I love you, you're my baby)
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I'mma stick with you
